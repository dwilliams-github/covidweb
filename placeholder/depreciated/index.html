        <h2>This site has been depreciated</h2>
        <p>
            The analyses this web site used to present are less
            relevant then they used to be. The reasons include:

        <UL>
            <li>
                Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a public health concern,
                the availability of vaccines and prevalence of at least
                partial immunity due to prior infection means that COVID-19
                is no longer the threat it used to be.
            </li>
            <li>
                The availability of at-home testing has made public 
                data less useful for tracking infection rates, at
                least in the United States.
            </li>
            <li>
                Several of the data sources that were used in this web site are no
                longer supported.
            </li>
